**Before creating a feature request please start a discussion for the new idea**

It's important to discuss a new idea before starting to think about its implementation. This way we keep the discussion separate from the technical implementation details. Things to consider in the discussion about the new idea:

- Is your idea related to a problem?
- Describe the solution you'd like
- Describe alternatives you've considered

[Link to create a new idea](https://github.com/course-o-rater/course-o-rater/discussions/new?category=ideas)

**After the discussion create the feature request from the discussion**

You can create a new issue by clicking "Create issue from discussion" in the sidebar. The discussion will work as a background for the issue.

**Please describe the idea in one sentence in the title**

To keep issues atomic. Eg. "User can rate other reviews"

**Please describe how the feature will affect the codebase**

The technical implementation and what things should be considered.

This is a good place to ask questions or raise problems.

**Related issues, if any**

Either for context or direct dependency. Eg. "Related/dependent on issue X because ..."
